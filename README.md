#### Models & Dataset
SVM and Random Forest were applied to classify ten music genres from the GTZAN dataset, which
contains 9,990 entries of music records with 60 audio features. Precision, Recall and F1 scores were key metrics to
evaluate model performance.
#### Feature Engineering
Techniques such as low variance filter, univariate filter, recursive feature elimination, wrapper
methods, and PCA were implemented to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

#### Results

SVM with RBF kernel outperformed Random Forest, achieving a test accuracy of 93%. Random Forest
exhibited a test accuracy of 86%; Among feature selection methods, wrapper methods with SVM demonstrated the best
results with test accuracy of 88%.

#### Models & Dataset:
Date from Million Song Dataset subset of 10,000 songs.
Alternating least squares(ALS) and item-based collaborative-filtering(IBCF) algorithms were built for music recommendation system. Three sub models are developed to predict/recommend songs. All three models are tested with cross-validated.

#### Feature Analysis
Explored 7 categorical & 22 numerical features. Pinned artists' locations with geospatial mapping.
#### Results
Collaborative filtering model had a hit rate of 66% using Jaccard similarity and 48% with Cosine similarity.

#### Models and Dataset
Implemented multiple regression techniques (OLS, Ridge, LASSO) to identify the best model for
diabetes prediction based on health and socioeconomic factors. Dataset consists of 3K records and 22 variables.
#### Feature Analysis
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and principal factor analysis.
#### Results
OLS model yielded the lowest RMSE = 1.05. The strongest predictors of the diabetic population percentage
were obesity, physical inactivity, child poverty, and housing cost burden.

Utilized Python and Tableau to visulize scale and impact of fire.
Location mapping included.
