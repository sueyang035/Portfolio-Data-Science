Multiple supervised classification methods were developed, including, random forest and SVM.
Improve upon mdoel using grid search for best parameters. 
Evaludate with accuracy, F1 scores.

Alternating least squares(ALS) and item-based collaborative-filtering(IBCF) algorithms were built for music recommendation system. Three sub models are developed to predict/recommend songs. All three models are tested with cross-validated and compared using customized rating.

The objective of the study to help the company maintain stronger bonds with those high-spending customers in less marketing expenses. Here, I apply Segmentation on customers population and analyse their significant features. By applying KMeans Clustering along with PCA, I detect clusters with similar consumer behaviours. Clustering results were followed by predictive ML models, including training K-NN and Decision Tree classifiers, with Hyperparameter tuning and Cross-Validation. Finally, the models were validated through techniques such as ROC, precision, and recall.

## Micro Projects

- ### Statistics and Machine Learning

    - #### [Classifying/Predicting Modelling with scikit_Learn ](Classification)
Implement exploratory analysis and different algorithms including lineaer regression, kNN, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis with cross-validations on the wine quality and diabetes dataset. 

In this process, wine quality is modeled based on physicochemical tests by using various ML models and approaches as well as PCA for Dimension Reduction. 
Models include K-NN, SVM, Decision Trees and Clustering, where each modelâ€™s performance was analyzed using precision and recall.Results shows that the KNN algorithm has the best accuracy with a precision value of 98%. In comparison, the SVM will occasionally misclassify an item in the minority class, whereas the Decision trees are able to generate understandable rules without requiring much computation and prior knowledge
- #### [Bayesian Statistics]:
Bayesian statistics and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 

- #### [Classifying Modelling and Relevance Feedback Algorithm]:

I implemented KNN and Rocchio methods with TFIDF for text categorization. The output has shown that the most optimal kNN classifer outperforms the Rocchio classifer by approximately 1.5%, while with constantly better accuracy rate regardless of the number of K. While the dataset is large and the classes may not be linearly separable, kNN can handle complex classes better than Rocchio, which has a high bias and low variance.

 - #### [Linear Regression](linear_regression)
Performed standard multiple linear regression, lasso regression, rigid regression, and stochastic gradient descent for regression algorithms with feature selection methods. Finally, perform model selection to find the best "l1_ratio" parameter using SGDRegressor with  the "elasticnet" penalty parameter. 

 - ####  [Clustering on Newsgroup Subsets](KMeans_Newsgroup_subset)

In this file, I implemented KMeans Clustering based on TFIDF_transformed text dataset. For analyzing results, I have wwritten a function to display the top N terms in each cluster sorted by the cluster DF values for each term, the centroid weights for each term in the top N terms in the cluster (mean TFxIDF weight of the term), and the size of the cluster.
